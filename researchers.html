<h3>For Researchers</h3>
The tree of life is built for you -- by providing easy access to this data, we want to make you more productive,
and to inspire you and your colleagues to start new projects that wouldnâ€™t have been possible before the data
existed. By applying for access to the tree of life, you will be able to:
<ul>
  <li>immediately access a large and growing pool of data from many diverse communities</li>
  <li>if needed, request deeper access to existing data from select individuals</li>
  <li>if needed, request new data from select individuals, mediated by the data collector</li>
</ul>

All data you have permission to access to will be provided using modern data analysis tools, including the ability
to use parallel processing and cloud computing for speed and scale.
