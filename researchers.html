<h3>For Researchers</h3>
The tree of life is built for you -- by providing easy access to this data, we want to make you more productive,
and to inspire you and your colleagues to start new projects. By applying for access to the tree of life, you will be able to:
<ul>
  <li>immediately access a large and growing pool of data from many diverse communities</li>
  <li>if needed, request deeper access to existing data from select individuals</li>
  <li>if needed, request new data from select individuals, mediated by the data collector</li>
</ul>

All data you have permission to access will be provided using modern data analysis tools, including the ability
to use cloud computing for speed and scale.
