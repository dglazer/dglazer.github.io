<h3>For Donors</h3>
We are enabling the citizens of the world to take part in the grand project of understanding the tree of life.
We are making it possible for you to contribute. (And learn about yourself in the process.) The base level of
participation pools de-identified data for the good of all humanity, while giving you (and your doctor if you
choose) access to the specific results. You’re also welcome to step up and provide more data about yourself,
if you want to further contribute to the project.

Optionally, you can also allow re-contact, either directly or via a trusted intermediary (e.g. your doctor, a
foundation), to share results, gather more data, and/or offer voluntary participation in followup programs.

You should understand that access is only provided to de-identified data, and that all researchers agree they won’t try to re-identify donors, but there is some non-zero risk of re-identification.
